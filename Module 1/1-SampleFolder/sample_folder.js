/*In this lab, you will develop an understanding of JavaScript variables, including var, let, and const. 
JavaScript variables act as containers for storing data, allowing dynamic programming by facilitating the storage, manipulation, and retrieval of values across various sections of code within applications. 
You will learn how to use variables to enhance code readability and maintainability, enabling efficient management and reuse of variable values throughout your entire programs.

/* Uncompleted assignment:
Create one block using {} and declare variables using let, const, and var.

Then, try to reassign these variables within the curly braces {}. Check for any errors that may occur.

Next, try to reassign the same variables outside the block {} and check if assignment outside the sope of variables where the variables are assigned can be done or not.
